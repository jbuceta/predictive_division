# Data
The \*.stl and \*_PPB2.stl files are all that is required for the pipeline and must be placed within the stls sub-directory.
Ultimately this directory will contains all the \*.stl, and \*_PPB2.stl files as well as the generated \*30.fe  and \*PPB2.fe files.

Please be sure that the corresponding \*.stl and \*_PPB2.stl files for each cell have the exact same file name, with only their extensions being different.
